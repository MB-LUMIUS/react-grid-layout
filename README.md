# React Grid Layout

## Disclosure
This is a personal fork of the React-Grid-Layout, which was originally written by Samuel Reed. The original repository and docs can be found [here](https://github.com/STRML/react-grid-layout)

## Differences between the original RGL and this one

I'm using this fork to introduce the ability to handle hidden elements for the layout editor that I'm writing.
The plan is to re-write it completely in TypesScript and to introduce hidden element logic in the **view mode** and **edit modes**.
